# Rust-Helia: Honest Implementation Status

**Date**: January 12, 2025  
**Version**: 0.1.2  
**Bottom Line**: ~50% complete - Core architecture solid, many packages need implementation

## TL;DR

- ✅ **What Works**: Core traits, blockstore, pinning, basic data formats
- ⚠️ **What's Incomplete**: Networking packages (IPNS, DNSLink, Routers, HTTP, Block Brokers)
- 🔄 **In Progress**: Bitswap (75% done)

## The Truth About Each Package

### ✅ Actually Complete (100%)

**helia-interface** (Published v0.1.2)

### ⚠️ Type Definitions Only (~30%)

**helia-ipns** (290 lines)
- **What's Real**: Basic in-memory publish/resolve, IpnsRecord struct, error types
- **What's Missing**: 
  - DHT integration (no actual DHT publishing/resolving)
  - PubSub routing (not connected)
  - Multiple routing strategies
  - Record signing and verification
  - Recursive resolution
  - Caching strategy
- **Estimate**: ~30% complete (local ops only)

### ❌ Type Definitions Only (~10%)

**helia-block-brokers** (75 lines)
- **What's Real**: `BlockRetrievalOptions`, `BlockAnnounceOptions`, `ProviderType` enum, `BrokerStats` struct
- **What's Missing**:
  - Trustless Gateway implementation
  - Bitswap broker integration
  - Provider selection logic
  - Session management
  - Retrieval strategies
- **Estimate**: ~10% complete (types only)

**helia-dnslink** (181 lines)
- **What's Real**: `DnsLinkError` enum, `DnsLinkResult` struct, `ResolveOptions`
- **What's Missing**:
  - Actual DNS resolution
  - TXT record parsing
  - IPFS path extraction
  - Recursive resolution
  - Caching
- **Estimate**: ~10% complete (types only)

**helia-routers** (150 lines)
- **What's Real**: `RoutingError` enum, `ProviderInfo`, `PeerInfo` structs, trait definitions
- **What's Missing**:
  - DHT routing implementation
  - Delegated HTTP routing
  - libp2p routing integration
  - Provider lookup logic
  - Peer discovery
- **Estimate**: ~10% complete (interfaces only)

### ❌ Non-Functional Stubs (~5%)

**helia-http** (282 lines)
- **What's Real**: Struct definitions implementing Blocks trait
- **Reality**: 
  ```rust
  async fn get(&self, _cid: &Cid) -> Result<Bytes, HeliaError> {
      Err(HeliaError::other("Block not found"))
  }
  
  async fn get_all(&self, _cids: Vec<Cid>) -> Result<...> {
      Err(HeliaError::other("not supported"))
  }
  ```
- **What's Missing**: Everything - it's a non-functional stub
- **Estimate**: ~5% complete (types only, no functionality)

## What This Means

### Compiles ≠ Complete

The project **compiles successfully** because:
1. All type definitions are correct
2. Traits are properly implemented (even if with stub logic)
3. Rust's type system is satisfied

But compilation success does NOT mean:
- Functions actually work
- Logic is implemented
- Features match TypeScript

### The Missing 50%

To reach true feature parity, we need:

**Critical Path (3-6 months)**:
1. **Block Brokers** (~1 month)
   - Implement trustless gateway client
   - Add bitswap broker integration
   - Provider selection and prioritization

2. **Routers** (~1 month)
   - DHT routing via rust-libp2p-kad
   - Delegated HTTP routing client
   - libp2p routing integration

3. **IPNS** (~2 weeks)
   - DHT publishing/resolution
   - PubSub integration
   - Multi-router support

4. **DNSLink** (~1 week)
   - DNS over HTTPS resolver
   - TXT record parsing
   - Recursive resolution

5. **HTTP** (~2 weeks)
   - Trustless gateway client
   - Block fetching
   - CAR file support

6. **Bitswap** (~3 weeks)
   - Finish coordinator
   - libp2p integration
   - End-to-end testing

**Nice to Have**:
- MFS verification
- Interop verification
- Data format package audits

## How We Got Here

The project was architected with a "types-first" approach:
1. Define all interfaces and types
2. Create package structure matching TypeScript
3. Implement gradually

This is a valid approach, but the documentation over-claimed completion by marking packages as "complete" when only their type definitions were done.

## What to Focus On

**If you want networking**: Implement Block Brokers + Routers first  
**If you want IPNS**: Implement IPNS + DNSLink  
**If you want data handling**: Data format packages appear largely functional  
**If you want Bitswap**: Finish the coordinator and libp2p integration

## Realistic Timeline

**Months 1-2**: Block Brokers + Routers (networking foundation)  
**Months 3-4**: IPNS + DNSLink + HTTP (naming and gateways)  
**Months 5-6**: Complete Bitswap, verify all packages, testing  

**Result**: ~80-90% feature parity in 6 months with focused work

## Conclusion

This is a **solid foundation** with **honest remaining work**. The architecture is good, the types are correct, and some packages genuinely work. But claiming 94% completion was inaccurate - we're closer to 50%, with clear paths to the remaining 50%.
